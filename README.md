This is a Git Hashing Exercise. We will generate a unique 4-digit integer, i.e. by using the last four digits of our student ID (AEM). We will create a script named hash_script, where it should take a 4-digit integer as input and output a hash of the input. We will use a  standard hashing algorithm (like SHA-256), run the script with our unique 4-digit integer and save the output in a file named hash_output.txt.
